# Svind

## Description

`svind` is a very simple PWA boilerplate that bundles `svelte`, `tailwind` and `now`.

I tried to keep the project as simple as possible but with enough to be able to write code right away without having to take care of the boring things first.

## Goal

- Tailwind support with optimization
- Now support
- Use of `snowpack` instead of `rollup` (thanks to `svelvet`)
- Progressive web application
- Automatic generation of favicons and `manifest.json`
- Automatic generation of webp images with a suited component
- Automatic optimization of images
