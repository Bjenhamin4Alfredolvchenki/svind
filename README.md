# Svind

## Description

`svind` is a very simple boilerplate of `svelte` and `tailwind`.
I tried to keep the project as simple as possible but with enough to be able to build the simplest SPA as fast as possible.

## How to

### Init

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gawlk/svind.git
cd svind
yarn install
```

### Run

#### Dev

```bash
yarn dev
```

#### Prod

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

### Deploy

#### Now

```bash
yarn deploy
```
